let x = 1;
function outer() {
  let x = 2;
  function inner() {
    console.log(x);
  }
  inner();
}
outer();

// the output will be 2 because create a variable and store the value then will create a naming function
his name is outer then create a variable and store the value is 2 then will be create a naming function his name is inner
then will console the x in outer function then will be call inner and outer function so that's why is 2
