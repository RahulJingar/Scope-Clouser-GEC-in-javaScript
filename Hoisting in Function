function testHoist() {
  console.log(foo);
  var foo = 10;
}
testHoist();


// the output will be undefined because create a naming function then will be console then will be declare a variable 
of var and store the value is 10 but compile is show the variable but not show the value so that's why print the undefined
but variable declare to let and const so will be output is reffrence error and show the before initialization
