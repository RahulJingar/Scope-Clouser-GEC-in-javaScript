function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    return ++count;
  };
}
const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter());
console.log(counter());

// the output will be 1,2 because create a naming function and declare the variable like that count and store 
the value is 0 and return the function then will be return the pre-increament count and outer function store a variable then call the function of 2 time 1st time print is 1 and 2nd time print is 2 that's it!!
